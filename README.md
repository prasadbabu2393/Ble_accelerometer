# Ble_accelerometer
The above uploaded program is about the  movement of the object wheather it is in the stationary state or moving state.
The object will attach by a Ble tag to it then it will send dummy data.
laptop bluetooth adaptor will read data which is send by Ble tag.
but, the above code does not have bluetooth heaader file which cause the error.
if we know the stationary point address, then we will match the reading data from laptop bluetooth adoptor.
so, we can tell it is in the statoinary state otherwise it is in moving state.
thus, i=this is about the uploaded of bluetooth tag with accelatorametere.
